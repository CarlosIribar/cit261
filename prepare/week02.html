        <p>
          This week all of the assigned readings will be from the
          <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html" target="_blank"
            >Eloquent JavaScript (EJS)</a
          >
          book. Remember though that if you are having trouble understanding a
          concept the way that this book presents it...go find another source!
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep the following Tips from week 1 in mind as well.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <h2>Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Read for understanding not completion. This means that some weeks
              when the concepts settle quickly in your mind you will fly through
              the reading. Week one is a good example. It is intended to be
              mostly review and most of you should get through it fairly
              quickly. Other weeks you might have to read several times...and
              spend lots of time working through the code examples until you
              understand. You may even need to go find a few extra sources on
              your own for some topics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't skip the code examples! Make sure to spend time reviewing
              these. With the book we are using you can actually interact with
              the code samples directly. Also work through the exercises at the
              end of each chapter. To help prioritize this I will require that
              you turn in at least one completed exercise from each chapter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take notes! Again I'm going to help you with this one by requiring
              you to turn in your notes each week. One of the most important
              things that you can include in your notes are questions that arose
              in your mind as you were reading. Having this list will help you
              to know what topics need more time, and will give you something to
              say when the instructor asks: "Any questions from the reading?"
            </li>
            <li>
              If I didn't assign a chapter in the book it is not because those
              topics are not important...but often because I expect you to
              already understand those concepts from a previous course. You may
              want to read some of the chapters I don't assign if the topics
              look unfamiliar to you.
