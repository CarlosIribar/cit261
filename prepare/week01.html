        <hr/>

        <p>
          As you begin with the first preparation activity for the course; it
          is crucial that you understand the importance of preparation. Do not
          treat these activities as a task to check off in as little time
          as possible. Instead, always treat them as opportunities to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is assumed that you know and understand the
          concepts from the Prepare activities.

          The other activities and discussions will be designed to move beyond
          the readings: these activities give examples and use cases, and talk about potential
          problems. It is extremely important that you ask
          for clarification on parts of the readings that didn't make sense. Your instructor
          is happy to discuss them with you.

          <h2>Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Read for understanding, not completion. This means that some weeks
              when the concepts settle quickly in your mind you will fly through
              the reading. Week 01 is a good example. It's review and most of you should get through it fairly
              quickly. However, in other weeks you might have to read through the text several times and
              spend a lot of time working through the code examples until you
              understand. You may even need to go find a few extra sources on
              your own for some topics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dedicate sufficient time to your studies! For many weeks, the reading will make up most
              of the assigned work for the course. This means that most weeks
              you ought to plan on 5â€“6 hours for the reading assignments.
              Some of you will spend most of the time reading and understanding the concepts. 
              Others you may spend most of the time working on the exercises. Play to your strengths and
              spend your time where it will benefit you and your learning style
              the most.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Don't skip the code examples!</strong> Make sure to spend time reviewing
              these. The book you are using allows you to interact with
              the code samples directly. If you have time you should also work
              through the exercises at the end of each chapter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take notes. One of the most important things that you can include
              in your notes are questions that arose as you were
              reading. Having this list will help you to know what topics need
              more time, and will give you something to say when the instructor
              asks: "Any questions from the reading?"
            </li>
            <li>
              If chapters from the book weren't assigned, it is because you
              should already understand those concepts from a previous course. However, you may
              want to read some of the unassigned chapters if the topics
              look unfamiliar to you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Don't be afraid to find your own sources. Sometimes
                the way an author explains a concept will not compute with your
                brain. If that's the case, find another explanation! As a starting point, here are some
                resources you have free access to.
