        <h1>Weekly Report</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          In software development weekly update meetings are a common
          occurrence.  Sometimes called "standup" or "Scrum" meetings they are
          intended to be brief but complete accountability reports of each team
          members work since the last meeting. Awareness to problems can be
          raised...but this is not the place to solve them.
        </p>
        <p>
          A standup will generally involve each person taking about a minute to
          answer 3 questions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>What did I do since the last meeting?</li>
          <li>What am I going to do next?</li>
          <li>What are my blockers?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Blockers are anything that is keeping you from accomplishing your
          goals. They can include troublesome bugs, broken code, design
          questions that you just can't come up with a solution for, they can
          even be other people. "I just didn't get around to it..." is not a
          blocker...it is however a good way to get removed from projects and
          ultimately fired ;)
        </p>
        <p>
          Each week you will be required to complete a report addressing the
          three questions above.  Please complete this thoughtfully, and be
          specific.  For the second question (What am I going to do this week?)
          don't just say "Continue working on my project". Instead explain what
          you hope to get done on your project...ie "I will implement the add,
          subtract, and multiply functionality, including adding buttons to
          control when the functions are called".
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally one could go and look at the code repository for your project
          and see commits that match up with what you report at the end of the
          week!Don't skip over the blockers question! This will be your best
          path to let the instructor know how they can best help you.
