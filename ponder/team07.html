        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will have us look one more time at the Great hikes
          application. This week we will practice using localStorage, and get
          another opportunity to think about the architecture of our code by
          adding a comments system for the hikes.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

              <p>
                If you don't have a working copy of the Great hikes app then you
                can pull down
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261/tree/gh-pages/solutions/week05"

                >
                as a starting point.
              </p>
              <p>
                Review the code to refresh your memory on the structure we have
                used. Discuss with your group what methods and properties you
                might need to implement your comments. Try to organize these
                methods and properties according to MVC. A comment should
                consist of at least the name of the hike it is for, a type flag,
                a date, and the actual text of the comment.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">Type Flag? This is just to allow us to re-use this code. Later you might want to expand on this applications and add something like favorite parks or climbs, etc. It would be nice to re-use this module for each of those. Adding a <kbd>type</kbd> flag allows us to grab all comments or filter for a specific group.</p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Build out the objects and modules decided on in step 1.</p>
              <p>
                Create a new module for our Comments code. (You have a choice
                here whether you want to create one file and put model, view,
                and controller in the one file, or to create three files, either
                would be fine in this case) Create a class with a constructor to
                act as the controller. The constructor should set a local
                property called <code>type</code> when the class is
                instantiated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Create a method in the class called <kbd>showCommentsList</kbd>.
                For now it can just return some static text or log something out
                to the console.
              </p>
              <p>
                Insert your comment controller into the hike controller. Call
                the <kbd>showCommentsList</kbd> method when the list of hikes is
                shown to make sure that you have things connected up correctly.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you are looking at a specific hike it should allow you to
                enter a new comment, and should show all the comments below that
                form.
              </p>
              <p>
                Write the rest of the code to implement your commenting system.
                For now just store your comments in an array.
              </p>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Store It.
              </p>
              <p>
                Write the model code to store and retrieve the comments to/from
                local storage.
              </p>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>

                Filtering comments
              </p>

              <p>
                When you are looking at a hike details screen you should only
                see the comments for that hike. When you are looking at all
                hikes you should see all comments. Change your code to support
                this.
              </p>

              <p>Controlling comment entry</p>
              <p>
                When you are looking at a hike details screen...we should be
                able to enter a comment, when you are looking at all hikes you
                should not be able to enter a new comment. Change your code to
                support this.

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a

          >).
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
