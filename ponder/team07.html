        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will have us look one more time at the Great hikes
          application. This week we will practice using localStorage, and get
          another opportunity to think about the architecture of our code by
          adding a comments system for the hikes.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

                If you don't have a working copy of the Great hikes app then you
                can pull down
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261/tree/gh-pages/solutions/week05"

                  >this version</a
                >
                as a starting point (<a href="../solutions/week05/hikes5.zip">Zip archive</a
                  >).
              </p>
              <p>
                Review the code to refresh your memory on the structure we have
                used. Discuss with your group what methods and properties you
                might need to implement your comments. Try to organize these
                methods and properties according to MVC. A comment should
                consist of at least the name of the hike it is for,
                a date, and the actual text of the comment. You will also need a comment <kbd>type</kbd> to use as a key for when we store these to local storage.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">Type? This is just to allow us to re-use this code. Later you might want to expand on this application and add something like favorite parks or climbs, etc. It would be nice to re-use this module for each of those. Adding a <kbd>type</kbd> flag allows us to add comments for different things and grab all of them or keep them separate.</p>
              <p>It might help here to write out a list of steps that need to happen in order to capture a comment. A sample starter list can be found below.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>When the app loads we see a list of all hikes...below we should also see a list of all comments with type:hike.</li>
                <li>When a hike is touched it will show us the details for that hike. We should also see any comments for that hike, and an input and button to add a new comment.</li>
                <li>When the submit comment button is touched...</li>
              </ol>
              <p>From this we can start to infer some of the methods and properties we will need:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>A <code>getAllComments</code> and <code>renderCommentList</code> method.</li>
                <li>A comment <code>type</code> to use as a key.</li>
                <li>A <code>filterCommentsByName</code> method.</li>
                <li>An array to hold all of our comments.</li>
                <li>A comment should look something like this:
                    <pre><code class="lang-js">
    const newComment = {
      name: hikeName,
      date: new Date(),
      content: value
    };
                    </code></pre>
                  </li>
                <li>A method to add an event listener to the submit button.</li>
                <li>An <code>addComment</code> method</li>
                <li>...</li>
                
              </ul>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Build out the objects and modules decided on in step 1.</p>
              <p>
                Create a new module for our Comments code. (You have a choice
                here whether you want to create one file and put model, view,
                and controller in the one file, or to create three files, either
                would be fine in this case) Create a class with a constructor to
                act as the controller. The constructor should set a local
                property called <code>type</code> when the class is
                instantiated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Create a method in the class called <kbd>showCommentsList</kbd>.
                For now it can just return some static text or log something out
                to the console.
              </p>
              <p>
                Insert your comment controller into the hike controller. Call
                the <kbd>showCommentsList</kbd> method when the list of hikes is
                shown to make sure that you have things connected up correctly.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">If you are unclear on how to do this...go look at the existing <kbd>hikesController</kbd> class. Pay attention to how we inserted the hike model and view into the controller. Something similar would work well to bring our comments module (controller) in. Once the commentsController is part of the hikesController we have access to all of the class methods and can call them when needed (such as after we show the list of hikes).</p>
              <p>
                When you are looking at a specific hike it should allow you to
                enter a new comment, and should show all the comments below that
                form.
              </p>
              <p>
                Write the rest of the code to implement your commenting system.
                For now just store your comments in an array.
              </p>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Store It.
              </p>
              <p>
                Write the model code to store and retrieve the comments to/from
                local storage.
              </p>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>

                Filtering comments
              </p>

              <p>
                When you are looking at a hike details screen you should only
                see the comments for that hike. When you are looking at all
                hikes you should see all comments of type hike. Change your code to support
                this.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->

              <p>Controlling comment entry</p>
              <p>
                When you are looking at a hike details screen...we should be
                able to enter a comment, when you are looking at all hikes you
                should not be able to enter a new comment. Change your code to
                support this.

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
