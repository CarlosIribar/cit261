        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code and everyone
          successfully deploys the code to their individual Heroku accounts.
          Each week let someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.

              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Create a new html file. Add the code necessary to make it a
                valid document
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Add a text input and a button. Put an empty div with an ID
                  below those.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add a script tag, write a function that will read the contents
                  of the input, and write them to the div.
                </li>
                <li>Call the function when the button is pressed.</li>
              </ol>

              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Modify your HTML file:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Write a new function that expects a number as an argument. It
                  should take that number and sum all the numbers up to the
                  number provided. (ie n=5â€¦so it would do 1+2+3+4+5 = 15) It
                  should return that value.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When the button is pressed it should read the number from the
                  input. Make sure it is a valid number, call the summing
                  function you just wrote, and output the result to the div.
                </li>

              <p>Design a calculator object</p>
              <p>
                Part of your reading this week is about Javascript Objects. How
                could we re-structure our code to gather all the parts of our
                calculator into one object that could be easily passed around
                and used? Think about and list the properties and methods such
                an object would need to have.

                <!-- END STEP -->
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Create the calculator object</p>
              <p>
                You do not need to write the methods for this step but should
                list each of them out.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, we know that we will need a way to add...for this
                step I could do something like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
    const calculator = {
        function add() { 
            // code to implement add
            return;
        }
    };
                           </code></pre>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Make a Calculator</p>
              <p>
                Complete the object you designed above to create a calculator
                that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
              </p>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a href="" target="_blank">click here for the instructor's solution</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
