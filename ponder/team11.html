        <h1>Ponder Team Activity: Authentication with JWT</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This week we will dive into one method of authenticating front end
          applications using JSON Web Tokens. The activity will also ask you to
          do a bit of form validation. It may be helpful to review the
          <a href="../prepare/week10.html" target="_blank"
            >readings from last week</a
          >
          before you attempt this activity.
        </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
           
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Setup</p>
              <p>We need a few things to succeusfully complete this activity. The most important thing is a backend server to respond to our authentication requests. Download <a href="../resources/auth.zip">this node server boilerplate</a>. Expand it then open the folder in your editor. We need to install the dependencies for this application before we can use it, so you need to open a command line prompt and change to the folder that contains the code you downloaded. Then type: <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm install</code></pre> Once that finishes you can type:  <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm run start-auth</code></pre> This will start up our authentication server. It will be listening at <kbd>http://127.0.0.1:3000/</kbd> (Note this is a local address and can only be accessed from the computer running the server). </p>
              <p>
                We are also going to be making many AJAX calls for this activity.
                Some will get simple <kbd>GET</kbd>s, but we will also need to
                do our first <kbd>POST</kbd> as well to send the login
                information to our authentication server. We also want to pay
                close attention to handling errors. Begin this activity by
                creating a function we can use to make these requests. It will
                be similar to the <code>getJSON</code> method we created last
                week, but it needs to do more.
              </p>
              <p>If you review that function it looked like this:</p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
function getJSON(url) {
  return fetch(url)
    .then(function(response) {
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw Error(response.statusText);
      } else {
        return response.json();
      }
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
      console.log(error);
    });
}
              </code></pre>
              <p>
                We can use this as a starting point, but our new function needs
                to allow for different verbs (GET, or POST), and the addition of
                the data we might need to send. We can use this as a model for
                our new function:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
// Server Address
const baseURL = 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/';
// helper function to make an http request with fetch.
// returns a json object
async function makeRequest(url, method = 'GET', body = null) {
  // we will need to set some custom options for our fetch call
    let options = {
    method: method,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  };
  // if we are sending any data with the request add it here
  if (method == 'POST' || method == 'PUT') {
    options.body = JSON.stringify(body);
  }
  
  const response = await fetch(baseURL + url, options);
  // in this case we are processing the response as JSON before we check the status. The API we are using will send back more meaningful error messages than the default messages in the response, but we have to convert it before we can get to them.
  const data = await response.json();

  if (!response.ok) {
    // server will send a 500 server error if the token expires...or a 401 if we are not authorized, ie bad username/password combination, and a 404 if the URL we requested does not exist. All of these would cause response.ok to be false

    console.log(response);
    throw new Error(`${data.status}: ${data.message}`);
  } else return data;

  // not catching the error here...so we will need to catch it later on and handle it.
}
              </code></pre>
              <p>Note a few things:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  We are passing in several things...a url, a method that will
                  be set to <kbd>GET</kbd> if nothing else is provided, and a
                  <kbd>body</kbd> argument that will sometimes contain the
                  information we need to send to the API, and sometimes will be
                  null.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We will need to send in a custom options object to
                  <kbd>fetch</kbd>. We need to specify method (GET is the
                  default), and then we will need to set some headers. Headers
                  contain information that changes how the server we are
                  communicating to will treat our request. We have set one for
                  now: we tell the server that we are sending/expecting JSON.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Next we check if the method is either <kbd>POST</kbd> or
                  <kbd>PUT</kbd>. Both of these methods involve sending data
                  with the request. We add that to the <kbd>body</kbd> of our
                  request...making sure to convert it to a string
                  (JSON.stringify).
                </li>
                <li>
                  This example also uses async/await to process the Promises.
                  The next line actually makes the fetch request, passing in the
                  URL (which we have been doing) and also our options object
                  (which we haven't done before)
                </li>
                <li>Next we process the response as JSON.</li>
                <li>
                  Now we do some error checking to see if our request worked the
                  way we expected. If it didn't we throw and error, if it did we
                  return the data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Notice that we aren't catching the error here...we will need
                  to make sure we do that later.
                </li>
                
              </ol>
              <p>Create a folder to contain the client side files for the project. Create an <kbd>authHelpers.js</kbd> file and put our <code>makeRequest</code> function in there...export it. Create also an HTML file called <kbd>index.html</kbd>. Test your server and function by trying this:</p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
makeRequest('login', 'POST', {
password: 'user1',
email: 'user1@email.com'
});
              </code></pre>
              <p>If you open the debugger tools and select the "Network" tab in Chrome you should see all of the requests that your browser has made. Some were to load the html, css, and JS resources, but at the bottom you should see one or two requests to <kbd>login</kbd>. That was in result of our call with <code>makeRequest</code>. Click on the last one. You can see the Request and Response headers, and if you select the Resonpse tab you can see what was sent back. You should see an object with an accessToken in it.</p>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Login Form and Auth module.
              </p>
              <p>
                Add a Login form to your <kbd>index.html</kbd>. You will need a two inputs: one for the email (username) and one for password. Create an <kbd>auth.js</kbd> file, add a class to it called <code>Auth</code> and export it.
              </p>
              <p>To help you get your authentication working you can start with this code:</p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">//Auth class which provides basic JWT based authentication for our app.
// Requires: access to the makeRequest  functions
import { makeRequest } from './authHelpers.js';
export default class Auth {
  constructor() {
    this.jwtToken = '';
    this.user = {};
  }

  async login(callback) {
    // replace the ids below with whatever you used in your form.
    const password = document.getElementById('password');
    const username = document.getElementById('username');
    const postData = {
      email: username.value,
      password: password.value  
    };
    try {
      // use the makeRequest function to pass our credentials to the server
      
      // if we get a successful response...we have a token!  Store it since we will need to send it with every request to the API.
      
      // let's get the user details as well and store them locally in the class
      // you can pass a query to the API by appending it on the end of the url like this: 'users?email=' + email
      
      // hide the login form.
      document.getElementById('login').classList.add('hidden');
      // clear the password
      password.value = '';
      
      // since we have a token let's go grab some data from the API by executing the callback if one was passed in
      if(callback) {
        callback();
      }
    } catch (error) {
      // if there were any errors display them
      console.log(error);
    }
  }
  // uses the email of the currently logged in user to pull up the full user details for that user from the database
  async getCurrentUser(email) {
    try {
      
    } catch (error) {
      // if there were any errors display them
      console.log(error);
    }
  }
  
  set token(value) {
    // we need this for the getter to work...but we don't want to allow setting the token through this.
  }
  get token() {
    return this.jwtToken;
  }
} // end auth class
              </code></pre>
              <p>Add the code above to your Auth module. Then import your module into your HTML file. Create an instance of your Auth class and try calling the login method. If you look in the console of the browser you should see a 401 error. Since we did not pass in a correct username and password that makes sense.</p>
              <p>Attach a listener to the submit button on your login form that will call the <code>login</code> method from our Auth class when pressed. Then finish writing the code for the <code>login</code> method.</p>
              <p>Once you have the login working complete the <code>getCurrentUser</code> method. Remember that you will need to pass the token we recieved from the server with every request except for login or the server will reject the request.</p>

                It would be great if we could specify the radius we would like

                also allow the use to indicate the dates they would like to

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
