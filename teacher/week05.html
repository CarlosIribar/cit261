        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week is build design and build a simple MVC
          application. The students will take the code from the Hikes demo if
          you shared it as a starting point. The discussion they have at the
          beginning is probably as important as the actual implementation. You
          may need to say a few words about MVC to help get them started on
          their discussions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          Keep your comments short this week in your meeting to allow for
          students to ask questions about their projects. It would probably be
          helpful to give more examples of using the browser to
          debug...breakpoints, stepping, etc.
