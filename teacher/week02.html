        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The first team activity happens this week. There will be one most of the
          weeks. You can either designate groups, or let students self-select them. The
          activities are intended to be done in peer-programming style. Because this course is
          online, you might suggest something like multiplayer in
          <a href="https://repl.it/" target="_blank">repl.it</a> to code
          together. Screen sharing in Zoom or Hangouts can work as well. The
          teams need to schedule an hour at some point during the week for the
          team activity. This week they will build a simple adding machine.
        </p>

        <p>
          Encourage them also to look to other sources when things don't make
          sense. The book does a good job, but the way it addresses certain
          topics might be confusing to some students. Help them remember that
          there are other options. Several are listed in this weeks reading. 
          The notes they turn in do not have to be all from the assigned
          reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encourage the students to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>
        <p>
          Since the reading introduced object literals, mention in your meeting
          that almost everything in JavaScript (JS) is an object with properties and
          methods. Review the three ways to declare functions (declaration,
          expression, arrow) and mention that since functions are just objects,
          they can be bound to variables, passed as arguments in functions
          (callback) or made part of another object.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use something like <code>console.dir()</code> on an array to
          show them what an array object looks like as well to introduce the
          array methods. (<code
            >array.includes(element) .push .pop .shift .unshift .slice .split
            .reduce .filter array.map(callback)</code
          >). Keep in mind that the team activity for next week will also be on
          the array methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your demo should show examples of using <code>const</code> and
          <code>let</code>, and contain a review of the three methods for declaring
          functions in JS (function expression, function declaration,
          and arrow function). You could build on the
          <a href="../examples/calc/calc2.html" target="_blank"
            >calculator code from the team activity</a
          >
          (partially converted using an object or
          <a href="../examples/calc/calc3.html" target="_blank"
            >fully converted to an object</a
          >), or build a
          <a href="../teacher/random.html" target="_blank"
            >Random Sentence Generator Example</a
          >.
