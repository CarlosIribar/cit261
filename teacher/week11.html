        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week introduces front-end authentication
          with Json Web Tokens (JWT). In order to do this we need a back-end
          server to generate the token for us. The first part of the activity
          involves the students using some Node boilerplate that will
          provide this. If the students completed front-end workflow assignments
          from the
          <a href="../prepare/week09.html" target="_blank">Week 09 readings</a>,
          then getting this server set up should not be a problem. If they did
          not complete that, then it will be somewhat confusing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Remind students that they should be working on their personal
          challenges. The only assignment this week is the team activity (about 1 hour),
          so they should plan on spending the rest of their time working on
          their projects (about 7â€“8 hours).

        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          This week you could use your meeting for questions about projects. You
          should also spend a few minutes to make sure the server part of
          the team activity makes sense to the students. One of the biggest
          challenges is working with multiple servers. Their server will be
          listening on port 3000, and the front-end code will be on a different
          port. Navigating this could cause confusion.
