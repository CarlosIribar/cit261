        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity this week pulls together most of what we
          have learned this semester by having students build an app that will get the
          current location, then pull a list of earthquakes within a certain
          distance of that location from an API, and then displays them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Remind students that they should be working on their personal
          challenges. The only assignment this week is the team activity (about 1 hour)
          so they should plan on spending the rest of their time working on
          their projects (about 7â€“8 hours).
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          This week you could use your meeting for questions on projects. You
          should also spend a few minutes talking about using fetch to put/post.
          We will need to send in some request options in this case and cannot
          rely on the defaults. You could work towards something like this:
          <a
            href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261/tree/gh-pages/examples/week10"
            >USDA search example</a
          >. You will need to get an API key from
          <a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/index.html" target="_blank"
            >USDA Food Data Central</a
          >, then add a file called <kbd>keys.js</kbd> to that project with your
          API key in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a great opportunity to pull up the reading on Fetch from this week to
          talk about using a settings object to customize a fetch call. Also discuss
          how to make sense of API documentation, and using the
          <kbd>.gitignore</kbd> file to protect things like API keys.
