        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week tries to pull together most of what we
          have learned this semester by building an app that will get the
          current location, then pull a list of earth quakes within a certain
          distance of that location from an API and displays them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Remind students that they should be working on their personal
          challenges. The only assignment this week is the team activity (~1hr)
          so they should plan on spending the rest of their time working on
          their projects. (~7-8 hrs).
        </p>
