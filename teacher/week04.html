        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week is build a Tic Tac Toe board. The
          focus is on DOM manipulation and events. The trickiest part will
          probably be clearing the board when the button is pressed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          This week is all about archtecting and organizing code. For your
          meeting with them give an example of organizing code using ESModules
          and objects of some sort. This could be a factory function and
          prototype, an object literal, or an ES6 class. With the modules make
          sure to show that they need <kbd>type="module"</kbd> in their script
          tag in the HTML for it to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might then do something like this
          <a href="../examples/toDo/index.html" target="_blank"
            >simple To Do list</a
          >. My example uses the class syntax. I went this way for two reasons:
          one it tends to be more familiar with students coming from other
          languages, and two if they move on to do any work with Angular, React,
          Vue, etc this is most likely the syntax they will be working with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again don't worry about getting through the entire demo. The key is to
          show how they can use modules and objects to organize their code and
          make it reusable. You should also say a few words introducing MVC to
          explain some of the decisions you might make.
        </p>
        <p>
          Begin the demo with a bit of brainstorming on what parts and pieces we
          would need for the To Do list. Then help them to organize those parts
          based on Model/View/Controller. Then build out as much of it as you
          have time for. See the comments in the example code above
          (<kbd>todo.js</kbd>).
