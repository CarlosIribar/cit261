        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          No Team activity for this week. The students should spend almost all
          of their time working on their projects.
        </p>

        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          This weeks meeting might be short. I would use it entirely for student
          questions if they bring them. Help them to finish their projects. Let
          them know your availability for meeting one on one with any of them
          that need help.
