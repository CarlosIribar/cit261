        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          No team activity for this week. The students should spend almost all
          of their time working on their projects.
        </p>

        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          This week's meeting might be short. Use it entirely for student
          questions, if they bring them. Help them to finish their projects. Let
          them know your availability for meeting one-on-one with any of them
          that need help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another topic you can cover is the options for viewing apps
          on a mobile device. Review how to setup GitHub pages since many
          students are using it as a repository. You could also show them how to
          lookup IP addresses to make sure their computer and phone are on the
          same network. Demonstrate using tools like LiveServer in VS Code or the
          Brackets editor. For a webserver connect the phone browser to the
          computer.
