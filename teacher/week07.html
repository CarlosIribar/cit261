        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week should feel like mostly review. We
          will revisit the Hikes app one last time. Our goal is to add some new
          functionality...the ability to add comments. The students can start
          with
          <a
            href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261/tree/gh-pages/solutions/week05"
            target="_blank"
            >this version</a
          >
          if they need. Then they should use MVC to design and build a
          commenting system for the app.
        </p>

        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          The reading for this week introduces Asynchronous programming and AJAX
          using <code>fetch</code> and promises. This would be a good time to
          really talk about Single Page Applications (SPA) as this gives us the
          last piece we need to really build one. A possible example could be a
          <a
            href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261/tree/gh-pages/examples/spa-example-complete/"
            target="_blank"
            >simple routing system</a
          >
          for the Hikes app.
